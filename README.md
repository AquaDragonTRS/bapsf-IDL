# bapsf-IDL

This repository is a warehouse of IDL code developed at the Basic Plasma
Science Facility (BaPSF).

The **HDF5** directory contains routines for interfacing with the HDF5 files
generated during an experimental run on the Large Plasma Device (LaPD).

*Disclaimer:* The current code base has been utilized and developed at BaPSF
for nearly a decade, but has never been properly covered with tests.  Use this code at your own discretion and please post an issue if a bug is discovered.
